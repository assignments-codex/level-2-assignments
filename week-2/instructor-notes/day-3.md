**Theme:** Flexbox basics; inline vs block; advanced form layout techniques
**Style:** Live‑coding small, focused examples that learners can mirror quickly.

## Learning Goals

- Understand Flexbox container/axis, alignment, and flex growth/shrink.
- Contrast inline vs block rendering in practice.
- Apply Flexbox to lay out a form (columns/rows) cleanly.

## Live‑Coding Demo Checklist

- Build a minimal Flexbox container with 3 items; switch direction/justify/align.
- Show inline elements (`span`, `a`) vs block (`div`, `p`) side‑by‑side; style to highlight flow differences.
- Convert the Day 2 form to a two‑column layout using Flexbox utilities.

## Common Pitfalls

- Forgetting `display: flex` on the correct parent.
- Over‑nesting grids/flex unnecessarily; mixing width rules that fight Flexbox.

## Optional Extensions

- Responsive tweak: switch to single column under 600px using a media query.
