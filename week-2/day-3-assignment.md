## Objective

Demonstrate Flexbox fundamentals, inline vs block understanding, and an accessible form laid out with Flexbox.

## Requirements

1. **Flexbox Container:** A parent with three child items arranged in a row; experiment with `justify-content` and `align-items`.
2. **Inline vs Block Demo:** On the page, include examples of `span`/`a` (inline) vs `div`/`p` (block) with styles that reveal flow differences.
3. **Advanced Form Techniques:** Build a form with:
   - Text (placeholder + autofocus), Email (required), Password (required), Submit.
   - Associate labels; add minimal ARIA if justified.
4. **Flexbox Form Layout:** Use Flexbox to arrange the form (two columns on wide screens; one column on narrow).

## ACP Expectations
