## Goal

Show your end-to-end workflow: start a new project in VS Code, use Git/GitHub with ACP, add basic HTML/CSS content, and deploy to GitHub Pages. A short live-coding demo is required.

Time
5–10 minutes

Submission
Schedule and meet with a TA or Instructor to demonstrate the items below. After the interview, submit your repo link and live site URL in the LMS. The TA/Instructor will verify and issue the badge.

What to prepare

- VS Code with Prettier set as the default formatter and Format on Save enabled
- Git configured (user.name and user.email)
- GitHub account signed in
- A clean folder to start the demo

Interview flow

1. Start a project in VS Code

   - Create a new folder and open it in VS Code
   - Add `index.html` with a proper HTML5 boilerplate
   - Add one semantic section (header/main/footer), a nav with at least two links, and a short paragraph

2. Git/GitHub workflow (ACP)

   - Initialize a repo, add/commit your work with a clear message
   - Create a new GitHub repo and push
   - Create a branch, make a small change, commit, push, and open a Pull Request
   - Merge the PR to main

3. Deploy to GitHub Pages

   - Enable Pages for the repo
   - Verify the site loads at the live URL

4. Live coding (chosen by your TA/Instructor)
   - Option A: add a new semantic element and a small style (e.g., increase heading size); commit and push
   - Option B: add a new nav link and verify it works on the live site; commit and push
   - Option C: link a css sheet to the page

Rubric (20 pts)

- VS Code setup (0–5): Prettier is default; Format on Save works; project opens cleanly
- Git/GitHub workflow (0–5): ACP is clear; branch and PR used; messages are meaningful
- HTML structure and content (0–5): Valid boilerplate; semantic elements; simple nav and text; safe, readable markup
- GitHub Pages deployment and clarity (0–5): Live URL works; student explains steps concisely; repo and Pages links provided

Deliverables (after the interview)

- Public repo link
- Live site URL (GitHub Pages)
