**Goal:** Refactor a constructor+prototype pattern into ES6 class syntax and practice small class design.

## Steps

1. Create `index.html` and `app.js`. Add a constructor+prototype example (your own or a simple sample).
2. Refactor the example into a `class` with a `constructor` and at least two instance methods.
3. Add a small cooperating class (e.g., `HistoryStore` with `add`, `list`, `clear`) and show them working together.
4. Log a short console demo to prove behavior (`new`, method calls). Keep methods small and focused.

**Deliverable:** Public repo `w7-d1-classes`.
