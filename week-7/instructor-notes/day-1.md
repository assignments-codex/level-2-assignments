**Week‑7 focus:** OOP **classes** from constructors/prototypes. **Review anchor:** Week‑1 Git/ACP discipline during builds.

**Teach**

- Bridge: constructor functions/prototypes -> **ES6 classes** (constructor, methods, static helper).
- `this` in class methods; avoid arrow methods for instance methods when unsure.
- Keep **ACP** after each feature (ties to Week‑1 workflow).

**Demo (quick)**

- Refactor one small constructor+prototype to a class.
- Tiny domain: `ApiService` (skeleton) + `ResultItem` with `.toDisplay()`.

**Breakout - Class Fundamentals**

- Build two cooperating classes of your choice (e.g., `ResultItem`, `HistoryStore`) and log a short console demo.
- Commit after each method you add.
