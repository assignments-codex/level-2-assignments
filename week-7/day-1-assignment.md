# Assignment: Introduction to Classes

## Objective

- Review constructor functions and prototypes.
- Understand the basics of JavaScript classes.
- Learn the syntax and features of classes in JavaScript.

## Instructions

### Part 1: Review Constructor Functions and Prototypes

1. **Create a Constructor Function**:

   - Create a constructor function named `Person` that takes `name` and `age` as parameters.
   - Add a method to the `Person` prototype named `greet` that logs a message introducing the person.

2. **Use the Constructor Function**:
   - Create an instance of the `Person` constructor function with the name "Alice" and age 30.
   - Call the `greet` method on the instance.

### Part 2: Introduction to Classes

1. **Create a Class**:

   - Create a class named `Person` with a constructor that takes `name` and `age` as parameters.
   - Add a method named `greet` that logs a message introducing the person.

2. **Use the Class**:

   - Create an instance of the `Person` class with the name "Alice" and age 30.
   - Call the `greet` method on the instance.

3. **Add Another Method**:
   - Add a method named `haveBirthday` to the `Person` class that increments the age by 1 and logs a birthday message.
   - Call the `haveBirthday` method on the instance.

## Submission

- **GitHub Repository**: Create a repository named `js-classes` and push the following:
  - The JavaScript file with the constructor function and class code.
- **Submission Link**: Submit the URL of your GitHub repository. Remember to deploy your lab to GitHub Pages.
