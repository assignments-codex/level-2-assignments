**Theme:** In‑class graded mini‑build that proves learners can translate Postman insights into JavaScript that fetches and renders.

## Learning Goals

- Build a simple UI that can target **two different APIs** and render results.
- Demonstrate robust fetch flow and normalization.

## Live‑Coding Demo Checklist (prelude)

- Outline the assignment requirements and rubric.
- Model the first step (API A search function) and one render path; leave the rest to students.

## Assessment

See **Day 3 – Graded Assignment: From Postman to JS (Two APIs)**.
