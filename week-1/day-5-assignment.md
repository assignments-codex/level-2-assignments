#### Objective
Prove you are fully set up for the rest of Level 2 and can complete the ACP workflow independently.

#### Requirements
1) Public GitHub repo named `week1-setup-firstname-lastname` that includes:
   - README with sections:
     - System Info: OS and version, Git version, VS Code version
     - Git Config: outputs of `git config --global user.name` and `git config --global user.email`
     - Extensions Installed: Prettier, Live Server (and any others)
     - ACP Log: table with at least 5 entries (Change, Commands used, Commit message)
   - Source files used for the test (an `index.html` is fine)
   - Evidence of branch work: a merged Pull Request into `main`
2) Tools configured and used:
   - Git installed and globally configured with correct name and email
   - VS Code with Prettier and Live Server working
   - Repo created on GitHub, remote connected, changes pushed
   - `dev` branch created, PR opened and merged into `main`
3) Chromebook users using Codespaces:
   - Note Codespaces in System Info and include your Codespaces URL
4) Work mode and policy:
   - Individual work; pairing for help is ok but submit your own repo
   - You may read docs or tutorials, but do not use AI to write commands or content

#### Submission
