**Goal:** Collaborate via fork/clone and open a Pull Request.

## Option A - Use a Classmate’s Repo

- Pair up. **Partner A** creates a repo with a `README.md` that contains a `Contributors` section.
- **Partner B**:
  1. **Fork** Partner A’s repo.
  2. **Clone** your fork locally.
  3. Add your name under `Contributors` in `README.md`.
  4. ACP to your fork’s `main` and open a **PR** back to Partner A’s repo.
- Swap roles if time allows.

## Option B - Solo (simulated fork)

1. Create a repo in your account, then use GitHub’s “**Fork**” button to fork it into an organization (or a second account if you have one).
2. Clone your fork, make the change, push, and open a PR back to the original repo.
