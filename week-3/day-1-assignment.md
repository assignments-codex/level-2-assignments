# Assignment: JavaScript Basics

## Objective

- Review variables, data types, and operators.
- Understand objects and their properties.
- Learn the differences between dot notation and bracket notation for accessing object properties.

## Instructions

### Part 1: Variables, Data Types, and Operators

1. **Review Variables**:

   - Create a `variables.js` file.
   - Declare variables using `var`, `let`, and `const`.

2. **Review Data Types**:

   - In the same `variables.js` file, create examples of different data types: `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `object`, `array`, `null`, and `undefined`.

3. **Review Operators**:
   - Add examples of arithmetic, assignment, comparison, and logical operators in the `variables.js` file.

### Part 2: Objects and Properties

1. **Create an Object**:

   - Create an `objects.js` file.
   - Define an object with properties (e.g., `name`, `age`, `isStudent`).

2. **Access and Modify Properties**:
   - In the `objects.js` file, access and modify the object's properties using both dot notation and bracket notation.

### Part 3: Dot Notation vs. Bracket Notation

1. **Dynamic Property Access**:
   - In the `objects.js` file, use bracket notation to access properties dynamically.
