# Assignment: Advanced Functions

## Objective

- Understand constructor functions and factory functions.
- Learn about prototypes and inheritance in JavaScript.
- Review the key concepts covered during the week.

## Instructions

### Part 1: Constructor Functions

1. **Create and Use a Constructor Function**:
   - Create a `constructorFunctions.js` file.
   - Define a constructor function for creating `Person` objects.
   - Instantiate an object using the constructor function and log its properties.

### Part 2: Factory Functions

1. **Create and Use a Factory Function**:
   - Create a `factoryFunctions.js` file.
   - Define a factory function for creating `Person` objects.
   - Create an object using the factory function and log its properties.

### Part 3: Prototypes and Inheritance

1. **Use Prototypes for Inheritance**:
   - Create a `prototypes.js` file.
   - Define a constructor function for creating `Animal` objects and add a method to its prototype.
   - Instantiate an object and use the prototype method.

### Part 4: Review of the Week's Concepts

1. **Summarize Key Concepts**:
   - Create a `review.md` file.
   - Summarize the main points from each day of the week:
     - Day 1: JavaScript Basics (variables, data types, operators, objects)
     - Day 2: Advanced JavaScript Concepts (this keyword, JSON)
     - Day 3: DOM Manipulation (getElementById, querySelector, preventDefault, JSON)
     - Day 4: Promises and Async/Await (promises, async/await, fetch, setTimeout)
     - Day 5: Advanced Functions (constructor functions, factory functions, prototypes, inheritance)

## Submission

- **GitHub Repository**: Create a repository named `advanced-functions` and push the following:
  - The `constructorFunctions.js`, `factoryFunctions.js`, and `prototypes.js` files with all the changes.
  - The `review.md` file with the summarized key concepts.
- **Submission Link**: Submit the URL of your GitHub repository. Remember to deploy your lab to GitHub Pages.
