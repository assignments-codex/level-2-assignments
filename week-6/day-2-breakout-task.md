**Goal:** Understand common auth types and successfully make **one** authenticated request using a key.

## Steps

1. Read/skim docs for **API key**, **OAuth**, and **JWT** (any reputable source).
2. In `README.md`, answer briefly (1–2 sentences each):
   - When would you see an API key in **headers vs. query**?
   - What problem does **OAuth** solve compared to a static key?
   - What is a **JWT** at a high level?
3. Pick **one** key‑based API. Do **not** hard‑code the key in code. You can place the key in a `config.js` and include it in a `.gitignore`. Import the config file which includes the key.

4. Make a GET request that requires the key; show 3–5 fields on the page. Include a short “auth notes” section in `README.md`.

**Deliverable:** Public repo `w6-d2-auth-keyed-request`.
