**Goal:** Use `.map`, `.filter`, and `.reduce` to compute small summaries and render them.

## Steps

1. Fetch a dataset (any public API with an array of items).
2. Render a simple **list** of items.
3. Compute and display at least **two** summaries (examples):
   - Count by category/type.
   - Average of a numeric field.
   - Top‑N list by a metric.
4. Render the summaries in small “cards” (divs) using safe text (no raw HTML).

**Deliverable:** Public repo `w6-d4-transform-summary`.
