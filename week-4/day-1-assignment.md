#### Goal
Using a styling framework like Bootstrap or Tailwind, set up a page and apply basic utility styling.

#### Steps
1. Create `framework-setup.html` and include your chosen framework via CDN.
2. Add a heading, a button, and a card-style container.
3. Apply utilities/components for spacing, color, and typography (margins, padding, text sizes).
4. Optional: add a simple grid or flex layout to center content.

#### Extra practice if you want
- Deploy to GitHub Pages from a repo named `w4-d1-framework-setup`.
- Add link states and a clear focus style.
- Add a second card with an image and caption.
