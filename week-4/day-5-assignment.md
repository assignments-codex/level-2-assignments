### Part 2: Building the Header and Hero Section

1. **Build the Header**:

   - Create a `header` element that contains a logo and navigation links.
   - Use Tailwind CSS classes to style the header and make the navigation responsive using Flexbox.
   - **Verification**: Take a screenshot of your `index.html` file showing the header section.

2. **Build the Hero Section**:
   - Create a `section` element for the hero section with a background image and centered text.
   - Use Tailwind CSS classes for the background image and Flexbox for centering content.
   - **Verification**: Take a screenshot of your `index.html` file showing the hero section.

### Part 3: Building the Content Sections and Footer

1. **Build the Content Sections**:
