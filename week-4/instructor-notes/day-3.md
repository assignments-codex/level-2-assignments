**Theme:** Responsive design with Tailwind breakpoints (media queries)

## Learning Goals

- Understand Tailwind's breakpoint prefixes (`sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`).
- Make spacing, typography, and layout responsive without writing custom CSS.
- Build a minimal, responsive section using only utilities.

## Live‑Coding Demo Checklist

- Start with a stacked mobile layout; progressively enhance at `md` and `lg`.
- Change padding and text sizes with `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:` prefixes.
- Show one “before/after” to prove no custom CSS needed for many cases.
