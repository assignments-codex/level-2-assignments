**Goal:** Using **framework breakpoints** (e.g., `sm/md/lg` or equivalent), create responsive spacing, layout, and type scale.

## Steps

1. Create `responsive.html` and include your **styling framework**.
2. Build a simple layout with a header, content area, and footer.
3. Apply responsive utilities for:
   - **Layout:** stack on mobile -> split columns on medium+.
   - **Spacing:** margins/padding increase at larger breakpoints.
   - **Typography:** headings/body text scale up at larger breakpoints.
4. Verify behavior by resizing the browser or using DevTools.

**Deliverable:** Public repo `w4-d3-responsive` deployed to GitHub Pages.
