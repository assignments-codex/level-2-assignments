**Goal:** Create two grid layouts using **framework grid utilities**; if limited, use plain CSS grid for the second example.

## Steps

1. Create `grid.html` and include your **styling framework**.
2. **Grid(framework utilities):** a 3‑column grid with gaps and 6 items.
3. Try rebuilding the same layout with CSS to compare how they work.

**Deliverable:** Public repo `w4-d4-grid-framework`.
