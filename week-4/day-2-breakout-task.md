**Goal:** Build two small flex layouts and practice responsive switches and ordering.

## Steps

1. Create `flexbox.html` and include your chosen **styling framework** (CDN).
2. **Layout A:** 3 items in a **column on mobile** -> **row on `md:`/medium**; center items both directions; add `gap`.

3. Give each item a distinct background for visibility; add minimal padding.

4. Explore the docs of the framework and see if you can find pre-made components.

**Deliverable:** Public repo `w4-d2-flexbox-framework`.
