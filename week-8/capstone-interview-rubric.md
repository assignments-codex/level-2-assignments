Use on Friday. Each student presents as if interviewing for a job: show the live app, walk through code, answer questions, and complete a short **live‑coding** exercise. For team projects, assess each student individually.

## Evaluator Flow (10–12 minutes total)

1. **Live site demo** (≈2 min): problem -> solution -> core flow.
2. **Code walkthrough** (≈3–4 min): selected files/functions, design choices, trade‑offs.
3. **Q&A on code** (≈2–3 min): evaluator chooses areas; student explains to demonstrate understanding.
4. **Live coding** (≈3–4 min, no AI): implement a small task from the list below.

_Tips: Look for clear communication, safe DOM practices, and ACP discipline when students reference their repo._

## Scoring (100 points)

- **A. Live coding - 50 pts total** _(award 0/5/10 pts for each item)_

  - Correct, runnable solution to the prompt.
  - Basic edge‑case handling or input validation.
  - Clear, idiomatic JS (names, small functions).
  - Think‑aloud reasoning while coding.
  - Quick self‑check (console/test) and revise if needed.

- **B. Explaining code - 30 pts total** _(award 0/5/10 pts for each item)_

  - Design intent & trade‑offs (components/classes/services chosen and why).
  - Data flow & state/error handling (async patterns, fetch flow, guards).
  - Constraints & alternatives (security/keys, rate limits, performance).

- **C. Presentation & professionalism - 20 pts total** _(5 pts each)_
  - Live link first; links ready; demo follows a clear story.
  - Concise, accurate communication; appropriate technical vocabulary.
  - Time management; smooth transitions; stays within 10–12 minutes.
  - Q&A handled precisely; acknowledges unknowns and reasons about fixes.

**Total:** \_\_/100

## Live‑coding demonstration

You will be asked to perform **one** of the following tasks, chosen by your instructor:

- Write a small **pure function** given inputs/outputs.
- Perform **array processing** with `map`/`filter`/`reduce`.
- Implement a **string utility** (e.g., normalize, tokenize, or format).
- Create a **simple object or class** with one or two methods and show usage.
- Sketch an **async fetch skeleton** with error guards (no secrets, no real keys).
- Render a small **DOM update** safely with `textContent` based on data.

> Equivalent tasks of similar scope are acceptable. Minimal console checks or micro‑tests are encouraged.

### Passing guidance

- Typical pass: **70+/100** with a working live‑coding solution and clear explanations.
- Flag for re‑review if live‑coding fails **and** the student cannot explain core project code.
